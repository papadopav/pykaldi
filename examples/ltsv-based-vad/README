Computation of LTSV features used in the DARPA RATS project for SAD

test.png contains the spectrogram, the audio file and the ltsv features
and shows their validity for SAD. 

{ARMA, DCTF, LTSV}.py contain functions for the feature extraction

compute-ltsv-feats.py is the "binary" executatble

run_ltsv.sh is a bash script that calls the executable

wav.scp contains the input files as in KALDI

The initial values of the hyperparameters have been tuned for RATS.

If you want to create a plot similar with test.png you can use the option
test-plot, e.g python compute-ltsv-feats.py --test-plot=True scp:wav.scp ark:feats.ark
This option is just for testing and assumes that your wav.scp contains only one file.
